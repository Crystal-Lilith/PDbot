I"xHeartbeat ACKs are Discord's way of verifying on the client side whether the connection is still alive. If this is ;TI"qset to true (default value) the gateway client will use that functionality to detect zombie connections and ;TI"xreconnect in such a case; however it may lead to instability if there's some problem with the ACKs. If this occurs ;TI"$it can simply be set to false. ;TI"W@return [true, false] whether or not this gateway should check for heartbeat ACKs.;T:
